# Project Overview

This is a web project called "The Harbor of Memories". It's a "message in a bottle" style website where users can anonymously write and receive messages. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses Firebase for the backend to store and retrieve messages. The project is deployed on Vercel.

## Key Files

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website. It contains the structure of the home page, the page for writing messages, and the page for reading messages. It also includes the Firebase configuration and initialization.
*   `styles.css`: The main stylesheet for the website. It defines the visual appearance of all the elements on the pages.
*   `script.js`: This file contains the client-side logic for the website. It handles user interactions, such as switching between pages, sending messages to Firebase, and retrieving messages from Firebase.
*   `.vercel/project.json`: This file contains the Vercel project ID and organization ID.
*   `寄憶之海.docx`, `寄憶之海簡報內容與口說稿.docx`, `詳細功能與甘特圖.docx`: These are document files that likely contain project documentation, presentation scripts, and feature lists/Gantt charts.
*   The `音樂&音效`, `圖片`, and `影片` directories contain the media assets used in the project.

## Building and Running

This is a static web project, so there is no build process. To run the project locally, you can open the `index.html` file in a web browser. However, since it uses Firebase, you will need to have a Firebase project set up and the configuration details added to the `index.html` file for the full functionality to work.

## Development Conventions

The code is written in a clean and organized way. The JavaScript code is well-commented and easy to understand. The CSS is also well-structured. The project uses Google Fonts for the typography.
